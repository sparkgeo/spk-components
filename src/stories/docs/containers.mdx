# Containers

The Container components are a series of simple wrappers that utilise named grid areas to "slot" themselves into the relevant area in a corresponding grid template. The containers have styling that will cause them to take 100% of the height and width available, **if the parent element has an explicit height or width.**

The `grid-area` names that are currently used in the containers are:

* **MapContainer** - `map`
* **SidebarContainer** - `sidebar`

## Usage

The container components can be passed children and will act like a standard `div` (unless the parent element has an explicit height or width). They could be use to create custom layouts in a similar fashion to the layout components.
